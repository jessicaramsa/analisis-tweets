# abductor

Our project consists in the developing of a tool that analyze through natural language the main contetnt and intetention of a comment from a twitter post to help any kind of emerging enterprise to improve it´s sales.

We focused on the enterprises or people that sells or make propaganda through social media. Usually the products or services offered on post which get a reaction from people by commeting their feelings about the post.

Using a database we choose a twitter post and then we analyze the comments bellow it to, lately save the analysis´ results on our not relational database.

The analysis cosists on processing the iformation from the comments through the tool Natural Language Processing from Google Cloud , later, when we got the results, we´ll get the average emotional score of the post´s comments with three categories: good, bad and neutral.

Used tools: Google cloud, mongo db, NodeJS, Loopback and a stutter server.
